# Fjord — Development Plan

## Goal

A native Jellyfin frontend for Linux that plays video smoothly on NVIDIA legacy hardware using the mpv render API with real vsync feedback via `report_swap()`.

---

## Completed

| Phase | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| 1 — Foundation | Slint window, libmpv link, logging |
| 2 — Player | mpv render API, double-buffer FBO, vsync via `report_swap()`, audio passthrough, hwdec, playback reporting |
| 3 — Jellyfin API | Auth, library browse, continue watching / next up / recently added, direct-play URL, session persistence, auto-login |
| 4 — UI | Login, browse, home/movies/TV dashboards, posters, three playback modes, player controls overlay, settings screen, detail page, resume, seek bar |
| 5 — HTPC Polish | Resume freshness, server-side search, lazy library grid, full keyboard nav, context menu (`C` key + right-click), card badges, settings two-pane layout, Rust key handler with configurable bindings, disk caches (home/movies/series), `item-type` routing, canonical user state store |
| 6 — Packaging | PKGBUILD, desktop file, SVG icon, per-machine DeviceId |
| 7 — NVIDIA legacy fix | NVDEC stride diagnosis, `vf=auto` fix, expanded stats overlay |
| 8 — Code organisation | Split `main.rs`/`main.slint` into focused modules, `global AppState` singleton |

## Open Work

### Bug fixes

Ordered purely by severity. GitHub issue numbers (#N) are linked to the tracker; items without a number came from internal code review.

#### CRITICAL

- [x] **#30 — Crash when starting a new video while another plays in background** — Fixed: `start_playback` now calls `tear_down_player` first, which drops `render_ctx` then `player` in the correct order before creating a new instance. Also sends a stop report for the interrupted video.
- [x] **Player settings wiped on re-login after sign-out** *(code review)* — Fixed: `do_login` now clones `state.config` instead of calling `load_config()`, so all player/app settings survive sign-out + re-login. Only auth fields are overwritten. `Config` derives `Clone`. (`auth.rs`, `config.rs`)

#### HIGH

- [ ] **#37 — "Up Next" banner redesign** — current implementation fires after the video ends (wrong). Redesign as a Netflix-style overlay that appears *during* playback:
  1. At playback start for an Episode, fetch `GET /Episode/{itemId}/Credits` (Intro Skipper plugin, same as intro timestamps) and store `credits_start` in `VideoState`.
  2. In `wire_mpv_timer`: when `pos >= credits_start` (or `dur - pos <= 30s` if no credits data) AND `playing_series_id` is set AND banner not yet shown → fetch next episode via `get_next_up_for_series`, store in `next_ep_pending`, show banner with 30s countdown.
  3. **"Play Next"** → stop current + start next episode immediately.
  4. **"Skip"** → clear `next_ep_pending`, hide banner; video plays to natural end with no auto-advance.
  5. **Countdown hits 0** → same as "Play Next" (auto-play next).
  6. If video ends with `next_ep_pending` still set (user never interacted) → start next with no delay.
- [ ] **#36 / #35 / #26 — Stop report reliability** — (c) #26 fixed: `quit_cleanup` uses `rt.block_on()` after `window.run()` returns to send the stop report synchronously before the runtime drops. Remaining: (a) #36 pressing Stop removes the continue-watching entry, (b) #35 continue-watching disappears after restart (intermittent). Fix: sequence home refresh after stop report completes, not concurrently.
- [x] **#28 — KDE dims screen / turns off display during playback** — Fixed: three inhibitors active during playback: (1) `org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver.Inhibit` — screen blank/lock on all DEs; (2) `org.kde.PowerManagement.Inhibition.Inhibit` — display dim + sleep on KDE Plasma; (3) `systemd-inhibit --what=idle:sleep` child process — sleep/suspend on GNOME, XFCE, and any systemd-based DE. All released at playback stop. Each is best-effort/silent no-op when unavailable. (`playback.rs`)
- [x] **#27 — vsync setting has no effect; stats always shows "audio" mode** — Fixed: stats was inferring sync mode from `vsync-ratio == 0.0`, but the render API never populates `vsync-ratio`. Now reads `video-sync` property directly from mpv and displays it in the VSYNC stat row. Also logs the effective `video-sync` value in `log_decoder_info()` so the HTPC log confirms the setting took effect. (`fjord-player/src/mpv.rs`, `fjord-app/src/stats.rs`)
- [x] **#32 — mpv's own OSD shows when seeking or changing volume** — Fixed: `osd-level=0` set unconditionally in `Player::new()` init block. Not a `PlayerConfig` field — never appropriate to show mpv's OSD when we have a Slint UI. (`fjord-player/src/mpv.rs`)
- [x] **#31 — Overlay progress bar shows time but no bar** — Fixed: `alignment: center` on the seek-row `HorizontalLayout` was zeroing `horizontal-stretch: 1` on `seek-track`. Removed the alignment; bar now fills available width. (`player.slint:86`)
- [ ] **#33 — No volume overlay when changing volume** — volume changes via `VolumeUp`/`VolumeDown` keys have no UI feedback. Add a transient volume level indicator to the player overlay (similar to intro-skip banner), shown for ~1.5 s then fading.
- [ ] **#39 — Audio dropout when vsync=audio with bitstream passthrough** — investigate interaction between `video-sync=audio` and SPDIF passthrough; may need `video-sync=display-resample` when passthrough is active, or a different `audio-device` path.
- [ ] **#19 — Backspace/Escape behaviour in player** *(UX redesign — confirm before implementing)* — user expects: Backspace always minimizes (mini card in sidebar even when "video in background" is off), Escape always stops. This changes the three-mode playback design. Discuss and agree on the behaviour before touching `dispatch_player` in `keys.rs`.
- [x] **Sign-out doesn't stop active playback** *(code review)* — Fixed: `on_sign_out` now calls `do_stop_playback` first, tearing down mpv, resetting all player UI state, and sending a stop report before clearing session state. (`main.rs`)
- [x] **`item_type` never set in poster loaders** *(code review)* — Fixed: `spawn_poster_loading` now threads `i.item_type` through the metadata tuple and sets `h.item_type`; `spawn_series_poster_loading` hardcodes `"Series"`; `spawn_movies_poster_loading` hardcodes `"Movie"`. Context-menu "View Details" now routes correctly. (`poster.rs`, `movies.rs`)

#### MEDIUM

- [ ] **#20 — Can't navigate to Resume button in mini card with keyboard** — when a video is minimized to the sidebar "Now Playing" box, the Resume button is not reachable by keyboard. Add keyboard focus path from the sidebar to the mini card Resume button.
- [ ] **#22 — Subtitle list not scrollable with keyboard** — track panel subtitle list needs Up/Down nav. Currently the panel cursor moves but if the list overflows the visible area there is no scroll. Use `Flickable` or clamp `viewport-y` to the focused index.
- [ ] **#25 — Slight stutter when navigating to Browse All in sidebar** — the browse screen population (`populate_browse`) runs synchronously on the event loop thread; move to a background task or cache the filtered list so the UI is instant.
- [ ] **#40 — Volume control should show it has no effect during passthrough** — when SPDIF passthrough is on, mpv volume control does nothing. Show a visual indicator ("Volume: passthrough") or disable the volume bar.
- [ ] **#10 — Library search: left-key nav scrolls the view slightly** — viewport-y changes by a small amount on Left press in the library grid header-focused mode. Investigate the `Flickable` / grid focus interaction.
- [x] **Sign-out doesn't reset `settings_section`, `settings_focused`, `keybinding_focused`** *(code review)* — Fixed alongside sign-out playback fix: all three reset to -1 in `on_sign_out`. (`main.rs`)
- [ ] **`video.lock()` inside `invoke_from_event_loop`** *(code review)* — series/movie play-from-start paths lock the video mutex on the Slint event-loop thread, which can block if the GL rendering notifier holds the lock during `mpv_render_context_render`. (`context_menu.rs:239`)
- [ ] **"Reset to Defaults" button missing `refocus()`** *(code review)* — loses keyboard focus permanently after click. (`settings.slint:485`)

#### LOW

- [ ] **#21 — Subtitle list: no hover highlight, not mouse-scrollable** — add `hover-color` to track panel list rows and make the `Flickable` respond to mouse wheel scroll.
- [ ] **#11 — Stats overlay text cut off; redesign with section headers** — split into Video / Audio / Sync sections with headers; ensure long values (codec strings, etc.) wrap or truncate with ellipsis.
- [ ] **#24 — `I` key should only open stats overlay, not the full player overlay** — currently `I` calls `invoke_show_controls()` which shows the whole controls bar. Change to toggle only the stats panel (`show-stats`), leaving controls hidden if they were hidden.
- [ ] **#17 — Make icon backgrounds transparent** — the app icon SVG/PNG candidates have opaque white or coloured backgrounds; re-export with transparent background.
- [ ] **#18 — Add icon next to "Fjord" name in sidebar** — small logo/icon element in the left sidebar header area.
- [ ] **#23 — Show subtitle track name instead of filename** — mpv provides `track-list/N/title` (the metadata title) alongside `track-list/N/external-filename`. Display `title` if available, fall back to the base filename.
- [ ] **#29 — Subtitle language preference setting** — user sets a preferred language (e.g. "en"); at playback start, auto-select the first subtitle track matching that language. Store in `Config`. Add to Settings → Playback section.
- [ ] **#34 — Add "ends at" clock to player** — compute `now + (duration - position)` and display as a formatted wall-clock time in the player controls bar.
- [ ] **#38 — Investigate massive frame drops with vsync=audio (intermittent)** — sporadic large spike in dropped frames, recovered by switching vsync mode. Likely mpv audio clock drift or Wayland frame timing issue. Log `frame-drop-count` periodically; reproduce and capture stats.
- [ ] **`.ok()` swallows `get_item_detail` error in play-from-start** *(code review)* — network failure silently disables intro-skip and auto-advance for the session. (`context_menu.rs:257`)

#### DOCS

- [ ] **Stale comment on `context-menu-focused`** *(code review)* — says old row order; actual: `0=Resume 1=PlayFromStart 2=MarkPlayed 3=Favourite 4=ViewDetails`. (`app_state.slint:161`)

---

### Settings — remaining steps

- [ ] **Step 3 — Playback section**: intro skipper mode (`always-ask` / `always-skip` / `never-skip`) in `Config`; `playback.rs` reads mode; toggle in Settings → Playback. Also: subtitle language preference (#29).
- [ ] **Step 4 — Appearance section**: accent colour selection from a small palette; layout variants if needed.
- [ ] **Step 5 — Dashboard section**: per-row visibility toggles for home/movies/TV rows; stored in `Config`.
- [ ] **Step 6 — Server section**: open Jellyfin server admin web UI (launch browser or embed WebView).

---

### Remaining Phase 5 items

- [ ] **Cast member photos on detail page** — add `id` field to `CastMember`, fetch person portraits (`GET /Items/{personId}/Images/Primary`) via poster-loading pipeline, display above name/role.
- [ ] **Cast row keyboard navigation** — Left/Right through cast members on detail page; Enter opens person detail screen.

---

## Architecture notes

### mpv render API

mpv uses `vo=libmpv`. Two FBOs alternate each frame:

```
BeforeRendering:
  mpv_render_context_render(fbos[back])
  expose textures[back] as BorrowedOpenGLTexture → Slint draws it
  back = 1 - back

AfterRendering:
  if did_render: mpv_render_context_report_swap()   ← vsync feedback
```

`MpvRenderCtx` must be dropped before `Player`. Enforced in `VideoState` and the rendering teardown path.

### Disk cache

```
~/.cache/fjord/home.json       home row data    always refresh in background
~/.cache/fjord/movies.json     full movie list  refresh once per session on grid open
~/.cache/fjord/series.json     full series list refresh once per session on grid open
~/.cache/fjord/posters/<id>    poster bytes     permanent (never expire)
```

Warm start: all caches loaded synchronously before `window.run()` — window opens fully populated on the first frame.

### Poster loading pipeline

```
Tokio worker:
  fetch bytes (disk cache or HTTP, 8-connection semaphore)
  decode JPEG → SharedPixelBuffer<Rgba8Pixel>   ← Send
invoke_from_event_loop:
  Image::from_rgba8(buffer)                     ← !Send, must be on UI thread
  push HomeItem with poster into VecModel
```

### Thread model

```
main thread       Slint event loop + GL rendering notifier
tokio runtime     API calls, poster fetch/decode, home data refresh
16 ms timer       mpv event poll, position update, intro-skip, controls idle, progress report
```

## Deferred / future

- Gamepad / remote control — d-pad maps to arrow keys; formal evdev/udev support deferred
- `--htpc` / `--fullscreen` CLI flags — keyboard nav covers the use case for now
- Person detail screen (depends on cast row nav above)
- Dashboard row reorder (drag-to-reorder, Phase 5 Step 5)
