# Fjord — Development Plan

## Goal

A native Jellyfin frontend for Linux built with Rust and Slint. Uses the mpv render API so mpv renders directly into an OpenGL FBO, enabling `report_swap()` for vsync feedback — the approach that avoids choppy playback on NVIDIA legacy Wayland drivers.

---

## Completed

Full curated version history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) (git tags `v0.1.0`–`v0.4.2`). Full implementation detail per feature: `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Pending

Everything below is a real, unverified checklist item only — full narrative/design detail for each lives in CLAUDE.md's dated sections, not repeated here.

- [ ] Settings → UI → "On-screen keyboard" toggle (2026-08-27) — confirm it persists across restart, and that turning it off stops Enter from opening the keyboard on every affected field (typing/Backspace still work via a physical keyboard) while turning it back on restores it everywhere.
- [ ] Keyboard-seek logging (2026-08-28) — actively testable any time, doesn't need the original bug to recur: play anything, press Left/Right a few times, confirm `fjord.log` shows the new `seek_acc:` lines.

## Architecture notes

### mpv render API

mpv uses `vo=libmpv`. Two FBOs alternate each frame:

```
BeforeRendering:
  mpv_render_context_render(fbos[back])
  expose textures[back] as BorrowedOpenGLTexture → Slint draws it
  back = 1 - back

AfterRendering:
  if did_render: mpv_render_context_report_swap()   ← vsync feedback
```

`MpvRenderCtx` must be dropped before `Player`. Enforced in `VideoState` and the rendering teardown path.

### Disk cache

```
~/.cache/fjord/home.json         home row data    always refresh in background
~/.cache/fjord/movies.json       full movie list  refresh once per session on grid open
~/.cache/fjord/series.json       full series list refresh once per session on grid open
~/.cache/fjord/posters/<id>      poster bytes     permanent (never expire)
~/.cache/fjord/backdrops/<id>    backdrop bytes   permanent (never expire)
```

Warm start: all caches loaded synchronously before `window.run()` — window opens fully populated on the first frame.

### Poster loading pipeline

```
Tokio worker:
  fetch bytes (disk cache or HTTP, 8-connection semaphore)
  decode JPEG → SharedPixelBuffer<Rgba8Pixel>   ← Send
invoke_from_event_loop:
  Image::from_rgba8(buffer)                     ← !Send, must be on UI thread
  push HomeItem with poster into VecModel
```

### Thread model

```
main thread       Slint event loop + GL rendering notifier
tokio runtime     API calls, poster fetch/decode, home data refresh
16 ms timer       mpv event poll, position update, skip-segment (Intro/Recap/Preview/Commercial), credits auto-advance check, controls idle, progress report
```

## Deferred / future

- **Theming / layout customisation**: accent colour palette, dashboard row visibility toggles, row reordering — needs the full layout system in place first before it makes sense to build.
- **Vulkan rendering path** — second render backend alongside the current OpenGL path. Requires: Slint WGPU backend, `MpvRenderCtx` initialized with `MPV_RENDER_API_TYPE_VULKAN`, Vulkan FBO management replacing the current `gl::*` code. Enables true zero-copy decode on AMD (`hwdec=vulkan`, no CPU roundtrip). Selection would persist in Config as `gpu_renderer: "opengl" | "vulkan"`, taking effect on next restart. **Correction, 2026-08-17, live-questioned ("is this a fact?")**: this entry's original "Legacy NVIDIA hardware needs OpenGL" line (written 2026-06-24, the very first commit that added this item) was never actually verified — checked now and it's likely wrong, not right: the proprietary NVIDIA driver has shipped full Vulkan support since Vulkan's 2016 launch, Pascal (this project's own target GPU, GTX 1050 Ti) was a day-one Vulkan-generation architecture, and a live report confirms Vulkan 1.3.275 working on this exact card under driver 570.133.07 — well within the same 580.xx branch Arch already ships for it (see [phoronix.com](https://www.phoronix.com/review/nvidia-gtx-1050), [forums.developer.nvidia.com](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/vulkan-support-on-the-gtx-1050-max-q/70986)). None of Fjord's own extensively-documented legacy-NVIDIA bugs (stride corruption, VO-init race, HDR shader-compile crash) are Vulkan-specific either — all are OpenGL/EGL-Wayland-path issues. So there's no known hardware/driver wall forcing OpenGL on this hardware; a toggle would still be worth having (this project's OpenGL/EGL path has a long track record of NVIDIA-Wayland-specific bugs, so Vulkan could plausibly be MORE reliable here, untested either way), just not because of a compatibility requirement — see the `hdr`-branch memory / CLAUDE.md's HDR section for why HDR work itself doesn't need or benefit from this migration regardless.
- Gamepad / remote control — d-pad maps to arrow keys; formal evdev/udev support deferred
- **Dashboard row reorder** — drag-to-reorder; part of the future theming/layout customisation update
- **Trickplay** — seek bar scrub thumbnail popup. Requires: fetch Jellyfin trickplay manifest (`GET /Videos/{id}/Trickplay/{width}/tiles`), parse tile sheet dimensions (tile size, columns, rows, interval), cache tile images per video, render a thumbnail above the seek bar while scrubbing (position computed from `seek-hover-pos`). Deferred because it's a separate subsystem from chapter nav and the API surface needs more investigation.
- ~~**Multi-account / multi-server support**~~ — done. Fully subsumed by the Bonfire/JellyProfiles `Config` restructuring (`DeviceConfig`/`Vec<ProfileSettings>`) and `ProfilePickerScreen`; each profile carries its own `server_url`, so this is genuine multi-server too, not just multi-account on one server. See CLAUDE.md's Bonfire section.
- **Display mode auto-sync (resolution/refresh-rate/HDR to match video content), KDE-only for now** — live-reported 2026-08-14, a real HTPC hitch traced to the user's own separate `media_display_sync` script (polls Jellyfin's API independently, hit a 5s timeout, briefly reverted the display mode then switched back ~10s later — a real, visible HDMI renegotiation, but not a Fjord bug; Fjord's own stream never noticed). Discussed as a genuine future candidate: building this into Fjord directly would be strictly better than the external-poller approach — Fjord already has the real container framerate/resolution/HDR metadata synchronously from mpv the instant a file loads (no separate network poll to time out), and a mode switch could ride the existing skip-fade-to-black mechanism instead of happening as a raw visible renegotiation mid-frame. The real cost is that it's Wayland-compositor-specific, not a Jellyfin/mpv API surface — the user's HTPC (and only currently-testable machine) runs KDE Plasma, so a first cut would go through KDE's own KWin/kscreen D-Bus interface and be KDE-exclusive until/unless a second compositor is in scope to test against; no wlr-output-management (Sway/Hyprland-style) support without a way to verify it. Not scoped further yet — worth a proper `/plan` pass (mirroring how Watch Trailer/Bonfire were planned) once actually picked up, and reading the user's own `media_display_sync` script first (repo visibility TBD) to see exactly which mechanism it already leans on.
  - **Sharper motivating hypothesis surfaced 2026-08-15, during the HDR passthrough investigation above**: the script changes resolution/Hz *after* the video has already started playing — a live connector mode-set happening concurrently with (or right after) mpv's own render-context setup and `target-colorspace-hint` negotiation is a plausible, sensible interference mechanism (a DRM mode-set is a heavyweight, connector-level operation; racing it against mpv's own HDR-hint negotiation could easily reset or drop whatever was being negotiated) — genuinely the same *shape* of race this project already found and fixed once for a completely different reason (the VO-init-vs-render-context-creation race, see "NVIDIA HTPC: video-only-audio black screen" above). User's own planned test, not yet run: same file/script, once with resolution/Hz already correctly set *before* Fjord even starts (no mid-playback mode-set at all) vs. the current after-the-fact behavior — if the pre-set case works and the mid-playback one doesn't, that's a clean, direct confirmation. User's own words: "if the script interfere then i will push up the integration into fjord" — i.e., a confirmed race here is the trigger condition for actually picking this item up, not a hypothetical someday. If/when that happens, the fix this points toward specifically is doing the mode-set *before* starting mpv's own playback pipeline for that item (matching the already-established "resolve first, don't create the race in the first place" discipline this project keeps landing on elsewhere), not just retrying/reordering after the fact.
- **Poster/card scaling setting** — from Phase 117: with titles/episode names now always shown in full (no truncation), a very long title on the smallest card breakpoint (115px wide) shrinks that card's poster noticeably to make room. User's proposed fix: a settings toggle to use larger posters in the library/dashboard (more text budget per card before this becomes visible) rather than reintroducing a truncation cap. Would likely hang off the existing `dash-card-w`/`dash-card-h` breakpoint functions in `main.slint`, e.g. as a user-chosen size multiplier or an extra breakpoint tier. Alternative approach floated in the same conversation, not mutually exclusive: render the poster image full-bleed behind the title/subtitle text with a dark semi-transparent scrim, instead of a separate text block below the poster — sidesteps the whole shrink-to-fit problem structurally rather than giving the text more room. Neither implemented yet; revisit when picked up.
- **Real HDR passthrough — deferred, dedicated-branch work, not yet scoped in detail.** `Config.device.target_colorspace_hint` ("HDR passthrough" in Settings) very likely does nothing at all under Fjord's actual render path — mpv's own manual states `--target-colorspace-hint` "Requires a supporting driver and `--vo=gpu-next`", but Fjord uses `vo=libmpv` (the render API), which that option's sub-flags explicitly exclude. This plausibly explains the entire earlier "TV never enters HDR mode" investigation (see CLAUDE.md's HDR tone-mapping section and its NVIDIA-driver-support research pass) more directly than either the driver-support or KWin-bug theories chased first — see CLAUDE.md's "The likely real explanation for the whole HDR passthrough mystery" section for the full trace (mpv manual read directly, corroborated by a real KWin HDR developer's own blog post on Wayland color-management negotiation).
  - Real HDR passthrough would mean Fjord doing its own Wayland `color-management-v1` negotiation directly against its own Slint-owned surface, independent of mpv's `gpu-next`-only mechanism — a genuine rendering-layer redesign (touches how Fjord's window/surface is created and presented to the compositor), not a settings fix.
  - **User's explicit call, 2026-08-17**: build this, but after the Bonfire/profile work (Phases 3-6 of that roadmap are still genuinely unstarted, not just "in progress"), and on a dedicated `hdr` git branch rather than `main`, since this could leave the app broken for an extended stretch in a way almost nothing else in this codebase's incremental history has — see the `feedback_branch_after_release` memory. Also explicitly flagged: this may be capped by the user's own aging Pascal-era GPU (GTX 1050 Ti, frozen on the `580.xx`/`581.xx` NVIDIA driver branch) regardless of how correctly the Fjord-side work is done.
  - Not scoped in detail yet — the real first step when picked up is a proper `/plan` pass (matching how Watch Trailer/Bonfire were planned), not jumping straight to code. A cheap diagnostic worth doing first, on either branch: check `fjord.log` for an mpv-emitted warning about `target-colorspace-hint` being ignored for the active VO, to directly confirm the no-op theory before designing around it.
