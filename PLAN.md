# Fjord — Development Plan

## Goal

A native Jellyfin frontend for Linux that plays video smoothly on NVIDIA legacy hardware using the mpv render API with real vsync feedback via `report_swap()`.

---

## Completed

| Phase | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| 1 — Foundation | Slint window, libmpv link, logging |
| 2 — Player | mpv render API, double-buffer FBO, vsync via `report_swap()`, audio passthrough, hwdec, playback reporting |
| 3 — Jellyfin API | Auth, library browse, continue watching / next up / recently added, direct-play URL, session persistence, auto-login |
| 4 — UI | Login, browse, home/movies/TV dashboards, posters, three playback modes, player controls overlay, settings screen, detail page, resume, seek bar |
| 5 — HTPC Polish | Resume freshness, server-side search, lazy library grid, full keyboard nav, context menu (`C` key + right-click), card badges, settings two-pane layout, Rust key handler with configurable bindings, disk caches (home/movies/series), `item-type` routing, canonical user state store |
| 6 — Packaging | PKGBUILD, desktop file, SVG icon, per-machine DeviceId |
| 7 — NVIDIA legacy fix | NVDEC stride diagnosis, `vf=auto` fix, expanded stats overlay |
| 8 — Code organisation | Split `main.rs`/`main.slint` into focused modules, `global AppState` singleton |
| 9 — Bug fixes & polish | Crash on background-play replacement, stop report reliability, screensaver inhibition, Up Next banner, volume overlay, intro-skip race fix, mouse hover on cards/browse, browse search mouse focus, subtitle track labels, subtitle language prefs, "Ends at" clock, settings hover, random sidebar icon, transparent SVG icons, mark-played visual update in dashboards/library |
| 10 — Code review CR1 (2026-06-18) | CR-1–10: stale intro/credits tasks, Up Next short-clip guard, report ordering, pause desync, semaphore bypass, auto-login timeout, context-menu stale state, missing SeriesId, NW timer stamp, countdown TOCTOU. CL-1–6: reset_playback_ui helper, cache_path helper, generic load/save_cache, context-menu state helper, fetch_image_cached, dead stats branch. UI-1–6: episode right-click, browse right-click, TrackPanel extract, dbl-click fullscreen, "Series →" button, seek-drag throttle + commit. |
| 11 — Code review CR3 (2026-06-20) | CR3-1–9: hidden VLH activation, stale dropdown flag, SPDIF warning with all-off formats, seek-dragging stuck on Wayland, deser_deinterlace null crash, language list duplication, header stale, default_true dedup, CLAUDE.md table errors. |
| 12 — Code review CR4 (2026-06-20) | CR4-1–10: Player::new error cleanup, JoinSet panic flush in all poster loaders, settings scroll for all sections, Up Next countdown off-by-one, movies semaphore, auto-advance window guard, mid-session 401 redirect, dropdown model dedup, dead VLH up-nav guard, .expect() in library crate. |
| 13 — EAC3 passthrough diagnosis (2026-06-20) | Root cause (#39): tsched software timer caused PipeWire RT thread to miss 21.3 ms deadline at 192 kHz IEC61937 rates under GPU load. Fix: `api.alsa.disable-tsched=true` (hardware IRQ wakeups) + `suspend-timeout-seconds=2`. Now a Settings toggle. Do not use `api.alsa.headroom` — shifts audio timeline, causes frame drops under `display-vdrop`. |
| 14 — Settings: SPDIF per-format toggles, HDR passthrough row, virtual rows (2026-06-21) | Per-format SPDIF toggles (AC3/EAC3/DTS/DTS-HD/TrueHD) replace single passthrough switch. Tone-mapping row hidden when HDR passthrough on. Video-latency-hacks row hidden unless display-resample active. Cross-section passthrough+display-resample conflict warning. |
| 15 — Audio output device selector (2026-06-21) | Dropdown in Settings → Audio populated from `mpv --audio-device=help`. Device stored in `Config.audio_device`; applied to mpv at playback start. Content-driven popup width; keyboard nav fixed. |
| 16 — PipeWire IRQ scheduling toggle (2026-06-21) | Settings → Audio toggle (visible when SPDIF on + PipeWire/auto device). Writes/deletes `~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/fjord-alsa-irq.conf` and restarts WirePlumber on change. Config persists after exit; syncs down to false on startup if file missing. |
| 17 — Intro Skipper API v2 + generalized skip segments (2026-06-21) | Migrated from two old endpoints (`/IntroTimestamps`, `/Credits`) to single `GET /Episode/{id}/Timestamps` returning all 5 segment types. `EpisodeTimestamps` model with `Segment { start, end }` for Introduction, Credits, Recap, Preview, Commercial. Single generic skip overlay (`show-skip-segment` + `skip-segment-label`) replaces `show-skip-intro`. Timer checks segments in priority order (Intro → Recap → Preview → Commercial). Enter skips active segment (priority check at top of `dispatch_player`). Up Next banner: `next-ep-banner-focused` (0=Play Now, 1=Skip); Left/Right toggle, Enter activates. |

## Open Work

### Settings — remaining steps

- [ ] **Step 3 — Playback section**: per-segment skip mode (`always-ask` / `always-skip` / `never-skip`) in `Config` for each of Intro, Recap, Preview, Commercial, Credits; `playback.rs` reads mode per segment; toggles in Settings → Player. Credits additionally has an indented `up-next-timer-secs` numeric row (default 30 s, hidden when Credits ≠ `always-ask`) — controls the Up Next banner countdown before auto-advance.
- [ ] **Step 4 — Appearance section**: accent colour selection from a small palette; layout variants if needed.
- [ ] **Step 5 — Dashboard section**: per-row visibility toggles for home/movies/TV rows; stored in `Config`.


### Intro Skipper — additional segments

- [x] **Skip Recap** — done in Phase 17 (generic skip button, label "Skip Recap →").
- [x] **Skip Preview** — done in Phase 17 (label "Skip Preview →").
- [x] **Skip Commercial** — done in Phase 17 (label "Skip Commercial →").

### Phase 5 — remaining items

- [ ] **Cast member photos on detail page** — add `id` field to `CastMember`, fetch person portraits (`GET /Items/{personId}/Images/Primary`) via poster-loading pipeline, display above name/role.
- [ ] **Cast row keyboard navigation** — Left/Right through cast members on detail page; Enter opens person detail screen.

## Architecture notes

### mpv render API

mpv uses `vo=libmpv`. Two FBOs alternate each frame:

```
BeforeRendering:
  mpv_render_context_render(fbos[back])
  expose textures[back] as BorrowedOpenGLTexture → Slint draws it
  back = 1 - back

AfterRendering:
  if did_render: mpv_render_context_report_swap()   ← vsync feedback
```

`MpvRenderCtx` must be dropped before `Player`. Enforced in `VideoState` and the rendering teardown path.

### Disk cache

```
~/.cache/fjord/home.json       home row data    always refresh in background
~/.cache/fjord/movies.json     full movie list  refresh once per session on grid open
~/.cache/fjord/series.json     full series list refresh once per session on grid open
~/.cache/fjord/posters/<id>    poster bytes     permanent (never expire)
```

Warm start: all caches loaded synchronously before `window.run()` — window opens fully populated on the first frame.

### Poster loading pipeline

```
Tokio worker:
  fetch bytes (disk cache or HTTP, 8-connection semaphore)
  decode JPEG → SharedPixelBuffer<Rgba8Pixel>   ← Send
invoke_from_event_loop:
  Image::from_rgba8(buffer)                     ← !Send, must be on UI thread
  push HomeItem with poster into VecModel
```

### Thread model

```
main thread       Slint event loop + GL rendering notifier
tokio runtime     API calls, poster fetch/decode, home data refresh
16 ms timer       mpv event poll, position update, skip-segment (all 5 types), controls idle, progress report
```

## Deferred / future

- **Vulkan rendering path** — second render backend alongside the current OpenGL path. Requires: Slint WGPU backend, `MpvRenderCtx` initialized with `MPV_RENDER_API_TYPE_VULKAN`, Vulkan FBO management replacing the current `gl::*` code. Enables true zero-copy decode on AMD (`hwdec=vulkan`, no CPU roundtrip). Legacy NVIDIA hardware needs OpenGL; selection persists in Config as `gpu_renderer: "opengl" | "vulkan"` and takes effect on next restart. The `gpu-api` setting was removed (2026-06-19) because it had no effect with `vo=libmpv` + OpenGL render context — this feature replaces it properly.
- Gamepad / remote control — d-pad maps to arrow keys; formal evdev/udev support deferred
- Person detail screen (depends on cast row nav above)
- Dashboard row reorder (drag-to-reorder, Phase 5 Step 5)
